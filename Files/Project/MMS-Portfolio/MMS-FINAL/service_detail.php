                    You would not open a store in a deserted neighborhood, so why put a website online that nobody can find?</p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, this is where many businesses fail with their Websites. MMS will not only help you get your business online, but also

                    <p>Increasing the conversion rate is a function of the Website itself. But what is Conversion Rate? Conversion can mean a number of things
                     to different businesses, varying from an actual order being placed on a Website to a simple request for information or a contact call. So
                     different interpretations apply – but put simply: "Your conversion rate is the measure of your success at persuading your visitors to take
                     the action you want them to take"</p>
                    
                    <p>Once your visitors have found the website, it must be persuasive enough to get them to take the action that you want them to take, dependent
                     upon your business objectives. In the Internet world, "pull" marketing is king – your visitor is only concerned with what they want to achieve
                     and you have no direct control – so your Website must use Conversion Architecture to lead the visitor to where you want them to be.</p>
                    
                    <p>We always discuss in great detail the business objectives of all of our Customers before we carefully design and build each Website using

                    <p>Your visual branding efforts should be looked as an investment, not an expense. It helps with your brand's long term success and overall
                     marketing initiatives. Successful branding does not happen overnight- it is rather a long-term investment that is measured in regards to its
                     long-term impact. Visual identity plays a significant role in the way an organization presents itself to both employees and clients. The brand
                     personality always dictates the look & tone of the branding direction.</p>
