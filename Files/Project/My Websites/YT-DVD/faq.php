            <p>The Yellow Train school has two unique elements – Unique education and a unique learning space.</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>
                    <p><strong>Unique education</strong></p>
        
                    <p>In this age where commercialism has completely overtaken education, The Yellow Train School is founded on love for children.</p>
                    
                    <p>The education offered is unique because it not only addresses the head – the cognitive learning – but also addresses the heart and the hand.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Unique Learning Space</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The school is set up amidst a farm with abundant blue skies, green trees, farm land, animal friends, cycles and lots and lots of space to experience. And the school building with its classrooms, amphitheatre, play areas etc 
                    are built to complement the beauty of the larger environment.</p>

            <h2 class="subhd2">What makes the Teachers at YT different?</h2>
            <p>Yellow Train looks for two essential qualities in their teachers. One - love for children. Two - passion for education. If these two integral qualities are there, all else are worked around. If they are not there, nothing else 
            matters. This element in our recruitment process makes sure that every child at Yellow Train is loved. When it comes to the next important part of education we have an on-going continuous learning program for the teachers, all year long.</p>

        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What is the Board that you follow?</h2>
            <p>The school is affiliated to ICSE and IGCSE from Edexcel ( London Board of Exams). However during the primary years Grade 1-5 the school follows an integrated program that combines the best of both the boards. At Grade 8, children can choose to appear for either the IGCSE or ICSE.</p>
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What is the benefit of two Boards?</h2>
            <p>It is bringing in the best of both worlds. It gives children the advantage of leveraging on two curriculums. In the primary year's program, the Boards do not prescribe the books, the assessment methods etc. The schools have the freedom to enrich the curriculum with all possibilities. Therefore we have chosen to make the curriculum enriched by integrating the two and providing the student with a choice of a Board at the High School level.</p>

        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What does it mean when you say you are waldorf inspired?</h2>
            <p>The school is inspired by Rudolf Steiner and his work. Our understanding of child development rests on Waldorf Education and Steiner's work. As teachers our scope of work is in two areas. One in understanding the nature of the child and from that understanding emerges the real work with the child. Two in delivering the curriculum that addresses the head, hand and the heart. You will find more on this in the curriculum section.</p>

            <h2 class="subhd2">How far is it from Coimbatore city? Will you have transportation?</h2>
            <p>The school is located 16 kms from Lakshmi Mills on Avinashi Road. Yes, we have transportation from major locations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What are the School Timings?</h2>
            <p>The School works from 8.30 AM to 3.10 PM. Children will have breakfast and lunch at school. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What about assessments? What is the school's view on it?</h2>
            <p>Assessments are designed to have a realistic understanding of where one stands with respect to many areas and is a very helpful tool in measuring the progress. Our reviews include not only the cognitive element, but also all the other areas of development such as music, handwork etc. Children go through regular assessments without preparation and without the stress of examination all through the year.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">Will children have homework? Why or why not?</h2>
            <p>Yes. Children will have homework. Our belief is that every day the teacher has to do a lot of homework before walking into class and the children too have to work on themselves before coming into class. That builds mutual respect. However the work will not necessarily be only writing and has lot of variety and scope for child's creativity and originality. Children also have a monthly project, which is open ended and allows the child to present and prepare according to their individual capacity, interest and skill.</p>
        </li>    
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What about uniforms?</h2>
            <p>Children will wear uniforms four days a week but will have a dress code for the other days.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="subhd2">What about Food and Transport?</h2>
            <p>Children will have breakfast and lunch at school which comprises of healthy vegetarian food. Before leaving school they will also be served a simple drink and snack. Transportation is offered from various locations 
            and for exact details you can check with us when you come in person.</p>
