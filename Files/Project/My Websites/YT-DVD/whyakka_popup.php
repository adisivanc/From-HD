	<p>What should children call teachers? Mam, Miss, Teacher, by name? Is it a mere form of addressing? Or does it establish the quality of the relationship?</p>
    <p>Our children call us akka.</p>
    <p>Why akka? The teacher facilitates learning, growing and partners with the child in this journey called school and the larger journey called life. The feelings we want to evoke in the child when they think about a teacher 
    is one of warmth, love, respect and trust. And as children move into middle and high school a feeling of equality and mutual respect. And akka came close to this image. So we are akkas at the school, for our beloved children.</p>
