                <h2>Happy Teachers Sangha</h2>
                <p>Teachers of our School come together as a Sangha every morning â€“ practice mindful breathing, reading from various philosophies, singing and sharing, before 
                going into class and receiving the children. This practice helps the teachers to stay anchored and taking the positive group energy into their classrooms 
                for the new day.</p>

                <h2>Mindfulness Practices</h2>
                <p>To know oneself i.e. to become aware of one's thoughts, feelings and emotions is one of the key elements of true education. And to learn to build/nurture 
                relationships, resolve conflicts within and without is of immense value both in childhood and adulthood. Being Mindful is practiced in our school through 
                circle times, reciting Buddhist gathas, learn to communicate oneself, stories etc. </p>

                <h2>Sanctum</h2>
                <p>A special space in school to pray, to reflect, to get some time for yourself. The Sanctum provides every child the opportunity to be one with yourself 
                and get a few moments of calm, almost in a meditative way. The ambience is quiet, calm and peaceful.</p>
