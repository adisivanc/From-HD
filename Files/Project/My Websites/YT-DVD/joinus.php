        	<p>You could be a painter, a musician, designer, researcher, economist, philosopher, poet, scientist or an architect.</p>
            <p>All you need to have is passion for children and for the cause of bringing in change in education. </p>
            <p> You need to be driven to make that change. </p>
            <p>You will get an environment that is vibrant, charged, high energy and without the constraints of too much rules and hierarchies and with abundant love from children. </p>
            <p>We are looking for teachers from across disciplines to join us. Both in our Kindergarten and in our Grade Campus. Anyone who is interested can download the

        <div class="ytmethod_row2left">
            <p>Very often, experts in their field be it music, dance, science, photography whatever be the subject, come to interact with children. They also perform for children. 
            These conversations and experiences help them get in touch with what appeals to them and could provide directions for them in the future. Anyone who is interested in 
            engaging with children and presenting their work can contact us.</p>

        <h2 class="ytmethod_head">POTENTIAL PARENTS</h2> 
        <div class="ytmethod_row2left">
            <p>We believe that it is extremely important for potential parents to understand the philosophy of the school before they make their decision to join us. Orientation 
            Programs are held once a month where one of the senior faculty will take you through the philosophy of the school along with the program that the school offers. It is 
            important for every parent to be part of an orientation before proceeding with the admissions.</p>
        	<p>It is equally important for the school to understand the aspirations of the parent. Admissions are therefore granted only after the school has had a dialogue with 
            the parent after reviewing the Application Form.</p>
